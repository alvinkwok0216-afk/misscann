In the problem, three missionaries (傳教士) and three cannibals (吃人惡魔) need to cross a river using a boat which can carry at most two people.
However, when there is at least one missionary present on either river bank, there cannot be more cannibals than missionaries on that bank, 
or else the cannibals would eat the missionaries. Besides, the boat cannot cross the river with nobody on board. 
Under all these constraints, how can we safely transport all the missionaries and cannibals from one bank to the other without having the missionaries eaten? 
One solution can be found in YouTube at https://youtu.be/laLS8gHzROg 

This problem can be generalized to any number of missionaries and cannibals, and a larger boat capacity (the maximum number of people on the boat). 
With a larger boat, there is also an additional constraint that when there is at least one missionary present on the boat, there cannot be more cannibals than missionaries on board. 
Your program shall simulate the transportation process (not necessarily solving the problem). Initially, everybody is on the right bank of the river. The target is to safely move everybody to the left bank.
